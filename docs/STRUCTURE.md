# Site Structure

## Pages

Required:
- `/` Home
- `/book` Book a call
- `/privacy` Privacy

Optional:
- `/how-it-works`

No other pages should be created in v1.

Route mapping (current):
- `/` -> `app/page.jsx`
- `/how-it-works` -> `app/how-it-works/page.jsx`
- `/book` -> `app/book/page.jsx`
- `/privacy` -> `app/privacy/page.jsx`

## Homepage section order (do not reorder)

1. Hero
2. The Problem
3. The Solution
4. Why This (Differentiation)
5. Proof (early-stage acceptable)
6. Call to Action

## Call to action (locked)

Only CTA:
**Book a 25-min call**

No secondary CTAs.
No “learn more” buttons that distract.
