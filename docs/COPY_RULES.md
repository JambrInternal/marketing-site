# Copy Rules

## Write for one person

The buyer is:
- An owner or ops lead
- Busy
- Often reading on a phone
- Skeptical but open

Write like you’re talking to them between jobs.

## Say this more

- Missed calls
- After-hours
- Emergency vs routine
- Fewer interruptions
- Peace of mind
- Reliable coverage
- Protecting reputation
- Calmer office, happier crew
- Instant response (no voicemail)
- Support staff, do not replace them

## Say this less (or never)

- AI models
- Automation frameworks
- Technical architecture
- Marketing buzzwords

## Buying triggers to reference (plain language)

- A missed emergency call causes a complaint or lost job
- Owner is woken up too many nights in a row
- Office staff is overwhelmed or quits
- Seasonal surge overwhelms the team
- Answering service is expensive or inconsistent

## Length rule

If it takes more than:
- 10 seconds to scan
- 30 seconds to understand

…it’s too long.
